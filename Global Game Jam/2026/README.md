### Overview
*"Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes."* — Carl Jung

**Speculum Animae** (Latin: "Mirror of the Soul") is an introspective browser experience that invites you to embark on a profound journey of self-discovery. Through 15 carefully crafted philosophical stages, you'll explore the depths of consciousness, identity, and human existence—guided by the wisdom of history's greatest thinkers.

This is not a game in the traditional sense. It is a **mirror**. It asks questions without easy answers. It listens without judgment. And it transforms as you reveal yourself to it.

### How to Play

2. **Receive the question** — Each stage presents a philosophical inquiry (narrated aloud)
3. **Write your truth** — Reflect in the text area; there are no wrong answers

### Why Text & Voice?
We chose **writing input + voice output** deliberately:
- **Writing slows thought**, enabling deeper introspection
- **Voice creates intimacy**, as if the mirror itself speaks
- **No microphone needed** — fully private, nothing recorded
- **Accessible to all** — works in any modern browser
